# Project-6-SHA256

This project is a console application that implements text hashing <br>
using SHA-256, part of the Secure Hash Algorithm 2(SHA-2).

## Uses of SHA-256

SHA-256 is used in many circumstances, for example:

-To create website authentication schemes, using JWTs, HMACs and MACs
-To create digital signatures
-To secure blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum
-In anti-viruses, to compare the fingerprints of files and programs
-In version control systems like Git to check if data has changed

## Functionalities

The application has the following functionalities:

-Reading a message from a file
-Hashing a message using SHA-256
-Saving a hashed message to a file
-Reading a hashed message
